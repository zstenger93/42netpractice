# IP
IP is part of an internet protocol suite, which also includes the transmission control protocol. Together, these two are known as TCP/IP. The internet protocol suite governs rules for packetizing, addressing, transmitting, routing, and receiving data over networks.

IP addressing is a logical means of assigning addresses to devices on a network. Each device connected to the internet requires a unique IP address.

An IP address has two parts; one part identifies the host such as a computer or other device, and the other part identifies the network it belongs to.
# Switch
A switch connects multiple devices together in a single network. Unlike a router, the switch does not have any interfaces since it only distributes packets to its local network, and cannot talk directly to a network outside of its own.
# Router
Just as the switch connects multiple devices on a single network, the router connects multiple networks together. The router has an interface for each network it connects to.

Since the router separates different networks, the range of possible IP addresses on one of its interfaces must not overlap with the range of its other interfaces. An overlap in the IP address range would imply that the interfaces are on the same network.
# Subnet mask
A subnet mask is a 32 bits (4 bytes) address used to distinguish between a network address and a host address in the IP address. It defines the range of IP addresses that can be used within a network or a subnet.
